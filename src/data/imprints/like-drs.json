  "message": "Shout out to all my **liquid heads**.\n\nWelcome!\n\nThis is an playful experiment exploring an idea I have started calling imprints of experience. This idea can be traced to a short story I wrote a while back - [Experiences in Memory Space](https://futurewip.com/experiences-in-memory-space). My first ever piece of fiction.\n\nIn this story, Helen buys a Dub Pistols record and imprints it with a memory space before gifting it to her pal. Everyone reading these words should now be posession of a similarly imprinted record. One of two bad boy liquid DnB records out of a collection of four (see below).\n\n The first ever imprints of experience.\n\nA gift from Snip & the Tune Catcher!\n\nEnjoy the tunes, be sure to check back here now and again to see if and how this space evolves. Hopefully one day it will become a shared memory space, we can all help curate and evolve. But who knows. For now it is just a bit of fun! \n\n**Much love x**\n\n P.S sorry Sen not got the playlist for this one on YouTube yet.",
